usage of loaders inside webpack.config.js
{
    "entry" : ...
    "output: {
        "filename" :...
        "path" : ...
    },

    // loaders example
    module: {
        rules: [
			{
				test: /\.css$/i,
				use: [ 'style-loader', 'css-loader' ]
			}
		]
    }
}

// loaders that can be used for

for Styling  :
    "css-loader": "^3.4.0",
		"node-sass": "^4.13.0",
		"sass-loader": "^8.0.0",
		"style-loader": "^1.0.2",


for cache bursting : filename.[contentHash].XX
        output: {
		filename: 'app.bundle.[contentHash].js',
		path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
	},

for HTML:
    HtmlWebpackPlugin  - npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin
    //plugins
	plugins: [
		new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
			template: './index.html'
		})
	]

for production and dev version merge :
webpack.common.js
webpack.dev.js
webpack.prod.js
    npm i -D webpack-merge
    npm i -D webpack-dev-server
webpack dev server


HTML LOADER and FILE LOADER

clean webpack plugin

split entry in webpack.common.js 

use splitchunks in optimization part provided by webpack 4

BundleAnalyzerPlugin

Extract DOM injected css to seprate file with mini-css-extract-plugin

MiniCssExtractPlugin


finally miniize html
new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
			template: './src/index.html',
			minify: {
				removeAttributeQuotes: true,
				removeComments: true,
				collapseWhitespace: true
			}
		})

		
ADDED BABEl TRANSPILER into this webpack

AFTER ADDING BABEL-loADER , Babel-polyfill we saw a huge icreasse in the file size of vendor.js , need to adress this 

Try to add Babel 7 into webpack instaed of current babel6 , with new plugin like - Proposal Optional Chaining

Also Axios Http CLient lib is taking too much of size , may find an alternative to this.
see if u can enable gzip, brotil encoding compression using webpack dev-server or create a node server which supportr gzip (done)
	"dev": "webpack-dev-server --config webpack.dev.js --compress true --open",

=====================
Broti compression algorith via webpack can be best to serve gzip or brotli resources and place it in your server and your server extra load of comressing thing on the fly get reduced and based on the browser request one can serve brotli if support or else fall back to gzip

		browseer reuest heards might be as follows :
			Accept: */*
			Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
